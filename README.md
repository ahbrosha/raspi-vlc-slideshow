VLC Slideshow
=============

This project can be used to start a slideshow on a Raspberry Pi 3.
Just start the Pi and connect the flash drive __afterwards__.

Any VLC compatible media found on the drive will be presented in random order.
Pictures will be displayed for 10sec, while videos are played entirely.

Just executed `install.sh` to setup the Pi.
